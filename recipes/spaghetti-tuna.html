            you can have a wonderful meal!</p>

        <p><h3><ins>Ingredients:</ins></h3></p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 (5 ounce) can tuna packed in olive oil, undrained</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>½ pound spaghetti</li>
                <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
            <p><ol>
                <p><li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. 
                    Add onion and cook until beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes. 
                    Add tuna with oil, capers, and red pepper flakes; heat through.</li></p>

                <p><li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    Cook spaghetti in the boiling water for 1 minute less than the 
                    package suggests, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent 
                    sticking. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li></p>

                <p><li>Add cooked pasta to the pan with tuna and mix to combine. 
                    Add some of the pasta water and toss lightly until pasta is tender
                     yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 more minutes. Sprinkle with chopped 
                     parsley and serve immediately.</li></p>

            </ol></p>
