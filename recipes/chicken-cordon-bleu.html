              <h2>What Is Chicken Cordon Bleu?</h2>
              <p>A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese,
                 then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French
                  recipe, such as this one, are baked.</p>
                <p>Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets,
                     cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with
                      a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard.</p>

                      <h4>What Does '<ins>Cordon Bleu</ins>' Mean?</h4>
                      <p>"Cordon bleu" translates to "blue ribbon." According to Larousse Gastronomique, 
                        a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most
                         prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. 
                         The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu.
                          Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, 
                          became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared 
                          by the most prestigious chefs.</p>

                          <h2>How to Make Chicken Cordon Bleu</h2>
                          <p>There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method 
                            to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but 
                            here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
                            
                            <h4>Prep the Chicken</h4>
                            <p>Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create
                               thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper.

                            </p>

                            <h4>Assemble and Roll</h4>
                            <p>Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. 
                              Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure 
                              each roll with a toothpick.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Bread and Bake</h4>
                            <p>Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and 
                              evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll
                               with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted.
                            </p>

                            <h2>How Long to Cook Chicken Cordon Bleu</h2>
                            <p>This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350
                               degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink 
                               and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 
                               degrees F (74 degrees C).
                              </p>

                            <h2>How to Store Chicken Cordon Bleu</h2>
                            <p>Store your chicken cordon bleu leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge 
                              for three to four days. Reheat in the oven instead of the microwave to avoid sogginess.
                               About 10 minutes at 350 degrees F should do the trick.
                              </p>

                            <h2>How to Freeze Chicken Cordon Bleu</h2>
                            <p>To freeze chicken cordon bleu, simply arrange the completely-cooled rolls on a lined 
                              baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about two hours. Transfer the now-frozen rolls to 
                              an airtight freezer bag labeled with the date. Freeze for up to four months.
                            </p>
                            <p>To thaw frozen chicken cordon bleu, transfer the container to the fridge the night 
                              before you plan to serve it. Bake the thawed rolls for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F.
                            </p>
